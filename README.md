# Robust Mechatronic Systems and Control

Contents:
Written by Brian Lesko, the repository contains Matlab scripts demonstrating control theories largely originating from 
the book, Control of Mechatronic Systems, by Dr. Levent Guvenc. 

Creation of Contents:
With comments and figures, the scripts were mainly produced as project submissions for Robust Mechatronic Controls 8352 in contribution toward a masters thesis. While some code is built off existing blocks shared by Dr. Guvenc, the implementation of controls theory was mainly reproduced for learning purposes.

About Brian Lesko:
At the time of writing, 10/26/2022: Brian Lesko is, in part, a Graduate Researcher and Teaching Associate, a Masters of mechanical engineering student, and is studying mechatronic controls theory, vehicle systems, and robotics.
